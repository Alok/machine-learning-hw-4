START FROM SCRATCH, it's easier that way and you know what the code is doing


figure out where the alpha enters into things in p1, or if you need it at
all

TODO redefine s(x) to be take max(1e-8,s(x)) by default so you don't get
overflow

* [ ] fn to handle printing
* [ ] return lists of points from grad descent to pass into plotter
* [ ] define plot fn that takes in list of lists and plots them with their names
formatted and the right axes
* [ ] reimplement logistic risk
* [ ] reimplement logistic gradient
* [ ] write logistic stochastic gradient
* [ ] write kernel risk
* [ ] write kernel gradient
* [ ] write kernel matrix
* [ ] rewrite gradient descent
    * [ ] at every 100 steps, add w and R(w) to two lists to plot later

IGNORE EXISTING CODE UNLESS YOU'RE SURE IT WORKS. USE THE DEBUGGER NOW THAT YOU
CAN WORK THE DAMN THING


Finish write up
